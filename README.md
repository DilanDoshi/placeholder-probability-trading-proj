# Polymarket Probabilistic Trading with fractional Kelly and Markowitz Style Optimization for Risk Minimization
Placeholder repo for Polymarket Probabilistic Trading Project. We are currently writing a paper about our algorithm and mathematical methods for this project. We are undergoing live-testing and use of our strategies. Will be posting full repo soon. The description is as follows:

This project builds a fully systematic weekly betting framework for Polymarket stock-range markets by combining historical-return probability modeling with orderbook-aware execution pricing. It evaluates every primitive and synthetic bucket, measures edge, EV per dollar, and Kelly fractions, selects the best bucket per ticker, and then allocates capital using both fractional-Kelly and Markowitz-style optimization for risk minimization. The result is a rigorous, end-to-end pipeline that converts raw market microstructure and probabilistic modeling into coherent, risk-adjusted binary-bet portfolios.
